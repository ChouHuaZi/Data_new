# Data Description

This repository contains two main files:

1. **PK05.xlsx**  
   This Excel file includes all raw field measurements of chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen, along with five-band reflectance data for each sampling point.  
   - Data is collected across six sampling periods (months).  
   - Each month is indicated both by color-coding and a dedicated column labeled `month`.  
   - Fields include:  
     - `Chl-a` (Âµg/L)  
     - `DO` (mg/L)  
     - `b1` to `b5` (reflectance values)  
     - `month` (sampling month name)

2. **DO_estimate.py**  
   This Python script implements the optimal prediction model (Random Forest) for estimating chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen concentrations.  
   - It reads the input data from `PK05.xlsx`  
   - Trains and validates the model  
   - Generates spatial distribution maps of predictions

   Required Python packages:
   - `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `os`ï¼Œ`gdal`

3. **Remote Sensing Images**  
   Due to the large file size, the original remote sensing image data is hosted on Zenodo:  
   ðŸ”—  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16757492 or https://zenodo.org/records/16757492
   - This archive contains raw images of the aquaculture site for each sampling month.
